# Make this scenario:
#I created a proposal for the Describing and sharing our metadata challenge and saved it as a draft.
#It has not yet been published.
#The notification about the phase of the challenge reads "Challenge closed for responses. Proposal(s) open for comment."
#This notification should not be displayed until the proposal is published.
